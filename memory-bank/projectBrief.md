# Project Brief

## Purpose

The Cloud POS (Point of Sale) project is a comprehensive, cloud-based application designed to streamline retail and hospitality operations. It provides a secure, role-based access control (RBAC) enabled platform for managing sales transactions, inventory, user permissions, and business analytics. The system integrates frontend and backend components to ensure efficient, scalable, and secure point-of-sale operations, supporting multiple users with granular permissions to handle tasks like product management, user administration, and transaction processing.

## Target Users

This project targets small to medium-sized businesses in retail, restaurants, and hospitality sectors, including:

- **Business Owners**: Who need oversight of operations, analytics, and high-level permissions management.
- **Store Managers**: Responsible for inventory control, staff scheduling, and daily operations.
- **Cashiers and Sales Staff**: Who perform transactions, handle customer interactions, and require limited access to core POS functions.
- **IT Administrators**: Who configure roles, permissions, and system settings to maintain security and compliance.
